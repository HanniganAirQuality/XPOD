# XPOD
The XPOD is a low-cost air quality monitor that is meant for researchers. It's less user-friendly than the YPOD.

# Using this Firmware
**I personally recommend V3.2.3 **

To utilize the V3.2 firmware, you need to:
1. Move all un-zipped libraries into your your Documents/Arduino/libraries folder on your computer
2. Open the .ino file and wait for all associated .h & .cpp files open

# Data Analysis Notes
The XPOD V3.1.2 Firmware is currently the only one which has associated headers - please see the xlsx file in the V3.1.2 folder

# Update Tracker
Thanks to Izzy for this suggestion! Here we will be tracking each version of the firmware.
